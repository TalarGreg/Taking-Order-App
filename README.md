# MS Fabric Taking Order App (toa)

## General description
The solution is built natively on Microsoft Fabric and implements an end-to-end data pipeline for real-time order ingestion, transformation, forecasting, and reporting.

Daily Sales Dashboard – aggregated restaurant sales metrics refreshed from the gold layer.

10-Minute Forecasting Analysis – exploratory notebooks that generate predictive insights on near-term demand, based on machine learning models trained and evaluated in Fabric.

Synthetic (randomized) order events are generated by a local Python script and ingested through Eventstream into the Lakehouse bronze tier. Data Pipelines orchestrate PySpark notebooks that process and partition silver tables (orders, items, weather). From there, gold tables provide aggregated daily sales and features for machine learning. 

Training notebooks train and evaluate multiple models with metrics (RMSE, MAE, sMAPE, Accuracy@10%) tracked in MLflow.

# 1. Python script - data generation

The `gen_toa_data_v2.py script` generates JSON order events and sends them to the Eventstream `es_toa`.
It leverages the azure-eventhub Python SDK to publish data into Microsoft Fabric Eventstream.

The script uses a small file `order_id_counter.txt` to persist the current order ID so that, if data generation is interrupted, the sequence can continue seamlessly on the next run.

To run the script correctly, it is essential to provide valid `EVENTHUB_NAME` and `CONNECTION_STR` environment variables. These values can be obtained directly from the Eventstream Live mode under Source details.
