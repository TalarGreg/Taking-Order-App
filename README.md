# MS Fabric Taking Order App (toa)

## General description
General description
The solution is built natively on Microsoft Fabric and implements an end-to-end data pipeline for real-time order ingestion, transformation, forecasting, and reporting.

Daily Sales Dashboard – aggregated restaurant sales metrics refreshed from the gold layer.

10-Minute Forecasting Analysis – exploratory notebooks that generate predictive insights on near-term demand, based on machine learning models trained and evaluated in Fabric.

Synthetic (randomized) order events are generated by a local Python script and ingested through Eventstream into the Lakehouse bronze tier. Data Pipelines orchestrate PySpark notebooks that process and partition silver tables (orders, items, weather). From there, gold tables provide aggregated daily sales and features for machine learning. Training notebooks log multiple models (Linear Regression, Gradient Boosted Trees, LightGBM) via MLflow, with results analyzed and compared using standard metrics (RMSE, MAE, sMAPE, Accuracy@10%).
